name: Pre-release checklist
about: Complete one of these for each release. Designed to catch small mistakes and increase repeat-ability of our process.

Prior to moving into production, the following steps should be completed or confirmed:
- [ ] Update version number in the code being released
- [ ] Create a draft release in GitHub and confirm the correct commits are present
- [ ] Add version # and release # to this ticket
- [ ] Dev to send commit list to QA (or otherwise publish changelog)
- [ ] QA to schedule the release with staff/clients (daytime's best or when staff are available for rollback)
- [ ] All dev/test pipeline test suites green
- [ ] Dev/QA chat to plan prod verification testing (unless already automated)
- [ ] Release the code to production and complete smoke test
- [ ] Finalise/publish the release in GitHub, tagging it
